# install-golang

A Bash script that bootstraps and installs Go language in your home directory.

You need to have your C tool chain setup and installed already.

## Example on Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian

```
    sudo apt-get install build-essentials
    ./install-golang.bash
```

## Mac OS X ports

On a Mac you need [Mac Ports](https://www.macports.org/) and Apples' Mac Developer Tools (XCode for command line) installed.

```
    ./install-golang.bash
```
